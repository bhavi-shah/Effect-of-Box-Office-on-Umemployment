# Effect-of-Box-Office-on-Umemployment

This project aims to measure how reviews and ratings of movie
released in theatres to their sales at box office and to analyze how
Unemployment rate in US has effect on box office revenue. To start
with, we have taken movie dataset as primary dataset which was
retrieved from The Movie database (TMDB) and GroupLens online
sites. And Unemployment dataset from U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics website was taken as contextual dataset. We have
performed data preprocessing and cleaning both the datasets and we
have combined the two tables to form a final dataset on which
exploratory data analysis was performed to extract insights. Later,
we have applied predictive modeling algorithms to identify
meaningful patterns from the available data.
